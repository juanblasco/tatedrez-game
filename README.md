# Tatedrez Case Study

---

**Objective:**

Create a simplified prototype of the Tateddrez game, focusing on **code architecture**, **maintainability**, **readability**, and **modularity**. The goal is not to complete the task in 4 hours but to showcase your approach, structure, and practices within the allotted time. We prioritize quality over quantity or completeness.

---

### **Assessment Criteria:**

To ensure transparency, your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. **Code Quality:**
    - Maintainable and modular structure.
    - Adherence to clean coding principles (e.g., SOLID, DRY, KISS, Design patterns).
    - Clear and concise naming conventions.
2. **Scalability:**
    - Extensibility of systems for future features or game logic.
    - Consideration of how the code would handle increased complexity.
3. **Readability:**
    - Well-organized code with appropriate comments.
    - Logical file and folder structure.
4. **Problem-Solving Approach:**
    - Clear design of systems and ability to break down the task into smaller, manageable modules.
    - Documentation of decisions and assumptions.
5. **Autonomy and Ownership:**
    - Ability to demonstrate independence in implementing features within a given timeframe.
6. **Industry standards**
    - Knowledge and implementation of industry standards will be considered a plus.

### **Game Description and Rules:**

### **Key Mechanics:**

1. **Pieces:**
    - **Knight:** Moves in an L-shape.
    - **Rook:** Moves in straight lines (horizontally/vertically).
    - **Bishop:** Moves diagonally.

1. **Board Setup:**
    - A 3x3 grid like Tic Tac Toe.
    - Players alternate placing pieces until all six are on the board.

1. **Victory Conditions:**
    - A player wins by forming a line (row, column, or diagonal) with their pieces.

1. **Dynamic Mode:**
    - If no line is formed in placement, players take turns moving their pieces based on chess rules.

### **Requirements:**

1. **Scope for 4-Hour Limit:**
    - Implement **piece placement** and basic **board validation** for a win condition.
    - Use placeholder logic for dynamic mode (e.g., logging moves without full implementation).
    - We donâ€™t expect a fully functioning product but want to see how you approach and organize your work within the constraints
2. **Technical Constraints:**
    - Buildable on **Android (APK)**.
    - Use **Unity 2022.3.21**.
    - Free assets only
3. **Delivery Deadline:**
    - The project must be submitted within **4 hours** of receiving the case study link.

### **Submission Guidelines:**

1. **Repository:**
    - Fork or clone the provided repository and create a new one on your GitHub account.
    - Share it with "shanickgauthier" and "juanblasco," or make it public.
2. **Deliverables:**
    - Unity project files.
    - Android APK demonstrating the build process.
    - A text document explaining your design and technical decisions
    - ***Note :** Unfinished submissions are acceptable as long as they demonstrate the intended coding principles*
